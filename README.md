## How to Submit Your Assignment

1. **Fork** this repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone** your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   ```
3. **Create a new branch** for your submission:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b week1-SE323253
   ```
4. **Add your assignment** inside your designated folder.
5. **Commit and push** your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Week 1 assignment - SE323253"
   git push origin week1-SE323253
   ```
6. **Open a Pull Request** from your forked branch to the `main` branch of the **original repo**.
   - Go to your fork on GitHub.
   - Click the **"Compare & pull request"** button.
   - Ensure the base repo is the **original class repo**, and the base branch is `main`.

   - In the PR description, you can write any notes or explanations.

## Avoiding Conflicts & Merge Issues

To prevent your PR from being unmergeable:

- **Keep your fork up to date** with the original repo:
  ```bash
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/<classroom-org>/<repo-name>.git
  git fetch upstream
  git rebase upstream/main
  ```
- **Do not modify folders or files that are not assigned to you.**
- If your PR shows conflicts, **rebase and resolve locally**, then force push:
  ```bash
  git rebase upstream/main
  git push --force
  ```

## Feedback Process

- Teachers will review your PR and leave comments.
- You can push updates to the same branch to address the feedback.
- Once approved, your PR will be merged.
